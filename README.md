## Skills

#### Teamwork

- During my placement at the University of Essex as a Student Recruitment Marketing Frontrunner, I was involved in the planning and implementation of a marketing campaign; the campaign was created to showcase the inspirational stories of the university’s students and drive student recruitment. I organised the meetings for the campaign and informed the Marketing team on the objectives of the campaign, using an informative proposal and presentation. I liaised with each team member regularly to discuss the progress of each task via meetings, email, and telephone. I made sure to always speak in an encouraging, and polite tone to ensure I conveyed messages and information clearly. I asked questions for further clarification and voiced my concerns. The campaign was successful and received a lot of engagement. It contributed to the 15% increase in the number of learners that enrolled into the university that year. It also helped grow the university’s social media following by on Instagram.  

#### Communication

- I worked as a Student Ambassador for three years. It was my responsibility as a Student Ambassador to communicate the University’s strong brand identity to students, campus visitors who attend the university during open days. Whilst assisting at events such as Open days, I often interacted with a wide range of people and adapted my communication style to suit each audience. When approached by perspective students, I communicated in a calm tone, listen to their concerns, answered their questions, and informed them on what it was like studying at the university. One of the students I had spoke to at an open day, thoroughly enjoyed their experience and one year later they had decided to study at the university and even become a Student Ambassador!
