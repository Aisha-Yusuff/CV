## Hello, I'm Aisha Yusuff!

üë©üèø‚Äçüíª A motivated Junior Software Developer with a background in Marketing and Biochemistry, excited to start a career in the tech industry.

üç™ I'm a music-loving, concert-going, biscuit connoisseur! (Fun fact: My birthday is on National Biscuit Day!)

üíª As someone who loves a good puzzle, I'm attracted to a career in Software Development because of its problem solving nature and the ability to create innovative solutions to solve social issues. I'm a recent Makers Academy Graduate who has learned how to be a confident and creative coder, skilled in test-driven development and object-orientated programming. I'm looking for an opportunity to collaborate with an agile team, apply my skills, deliver high-quality code, and gain invaluable insights.

## Skills

#### Skilled Problem Solver

As someone with a curious nature who thoroughly enjoys finding creative methods to solve problems, I enjoy using my logical reasoning to improve and debug code. While working as a Student Recruitment Marketing Assistant, I was given the task of increasing the engagement and improving the conversion rate of student-generated content. To fulfil this task, I exercised my research skills and strong decision-making abilities. I was able to increase traffic to the university‚Äôs social media platforms and their student blog by 163% and turned them into conversions which aided in an increase in applications for the next academic year. I achieved this by researching the university's target audience and the latest digital marketing trends; analysing data from previous marketing content, and implementing a new advertising strategy.

#### Excellent Communicator

Having previously worked in various customer-facing roles, I am experienced in communicating with a wide range of audiences and adapting my communication style. I have the ability to deliver high quality verbal and written communication. In my previous role as a Consumer Services Assistant, I had to use my abilities to build and sustain positive relationships, provide solutions for customer enquiries, and translate the company's brand. At this role, I received great feedback and recognition for my ability to communicate with customers. I was also able to utilise this skill whilst working within multiple tech teams at Makers Academy, to explain concepts, share feedback and communicate ideas. A skill that is fundamental for a Software Developer role.

#### Strong Team Player

As a Marketing Assistant at an educational course provider, I was able to double the number of admissions for Healthcare-related programmes by working in a team to execute effective marketing campaigns. I consistently communicated with all team members to provide support when needed. I made sure to be attentive and enthusiastic when working on each campaign and always spoke in a polite tone to ensure I conveyed messages clearly. I also shared my opinions, concerns and asked questions for further clarification when I needed support. I also took on the role of leader during our initial meeting by asking all members of the team to share their strengths and prior experiences. This helped when I assigned tasks and ensured the strengths of each member of the team were utilized effectively. I was able to implement the skills I learned from this role into my final project at Makers Academy, where I had to work in an agile tech team to deliver a web application under time constraints.
